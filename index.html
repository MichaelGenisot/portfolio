    <div class="about" id="about">
        <p>Hi my name is Michael Genisot. I am currently a graphic communications student in my third year at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Graphic design started as a hobby for me, but it has turned into something I can see doing as a career. I have been creating logos, advertisements, and other promotional material for small businesses for the past 5 years. My favorite hobbies include singing, playing piano, and watching basketball, all of which find their way into my personal graphic design work.</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>I have created advertisements for many local businesses. These advertisements include Instagram and FaceBook ads, video ads, radio ads, and posters. I have also worked with other businesses to help create T-Shirts, stickers, large banners, hats, and vinyl signs. I have worked with companies to redesign logos, and create brand guidelines as well. Recently, I have also worked with The Second Half to design custom trading cards available to order by customers.</p>
